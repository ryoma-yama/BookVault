Use Conventional Commits for all commit messages.

Start the message with a type and optional scope followed by a colon and space, then a short lowercase description.

Examples:
- feat: add user registration
- fix(auth): handle token expiration
- style: apply formatting with biome

Do not capitalize the first letter after the colon.
Keep messages concise and imperative.
